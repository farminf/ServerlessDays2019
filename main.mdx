# Constructs

### CloudFormation Resource Library

- Represent all the resources available on AWS
- It contains low-level and high-level classes
- Low-level resources are generated from AWS CloudFormation resources type reference (The ones starting with ‘cfn’)
- High-level resources offer same functionality but much less detail required
- They offer smart defaults and defined automatic configuration

### Construct Structure

- They are normal classes in the code
- scope, id, props

---

export default Layout;

# Why?

- Multiple Stacks
- Multi Region
- Supporting All Resources
- Not easy but covers 100%
- imperative programming interface
- best practices
- code combination
- code completion
- private constructs

cdk versions check
cdk commands
no lines as yaml
test and debug


first present my self and ussage of cdk in da, how was the experience
